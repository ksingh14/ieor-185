# react-native-tinder-swipe
Tinder swiper implemented in react native

All thanks to https://github.com/brentvatne/react-native-animated-demo-tinder

Added a card underneath, buttons to swipe left and right, and tinder-like yes/no text overlaying the image.

(Note the the screen capture might be a bit out of date)
